    <p><strong><u>Name:</u></strong>Sinchan</p>
    <p><strong>Family:</strong>Shinnosuke,Himawari </p>
    <p><strong>About me:</strong><i>Many of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan's occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his mischievous behaviour. Consequently, non-Japanese readers and some viewers may find it difficult to understand his jokes. Some gags may require an understanding of Japanese culture</i> </p>
